# Baseball Expected Spray Chart
## Introduction
In baseball, the defensive shift has become more and more popular over recent years. A defensive shift is when the defense moves an infield player to the other side of the infield, they do this because that batter tends to pull the ball more, so if they have more defenders on the batter's pull side then they can potentially make it harder for him to get a hit. You can read more information about the shift [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_positioning).

Teams have many different ways that they develop their shift, but essentially you want information about the batter and pitcher to create this shift. Some problems can arrise when only looking at the specific batter or pitcher in this because when a rookie player comes up to the MLB, they have very limited data available, baseball's version of a cold start problem! In this repo, I explore a technique to combat this problem.
